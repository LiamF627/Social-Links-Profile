## My process

  For this project I started out with a css reset. After that i set up my semantic tags and placed my divs inside. Then I made a div for every 'box' in the parent container.
  After this all I did was some basic css to style it to fit the dimensions. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Over this project I learned a lot about the use of divs, containers, and semantic containers. Also I learned about CSS resets through a reference used, which is great.


### Continued development

Something I want to conntinue to work on is my use of divs, and other containers, how they work, when they're needed, and how to use the display properties better. Eventually I want to master the use of grid box, which is something I very much struggle with currently.
